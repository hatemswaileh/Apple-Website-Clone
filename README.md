## üìù Acknowledgments

- If you are applying issues, Please just use HTML & CSS
- Please keep in mind that this project is not fully functional, it's just a Layout Clone for Apple Website
- Added the background image as a cover for the `background-size`.
- Background gradient colors for the Navigation Bar.
- Used Font Awesome for the Apple Logo and used Background gradient colors, with transparency for the font color with `background-clip` and text fill color so it can take the background gradient color to make it look like the logo image in the original website.
- For the search bar, I used `input type="text"` so I can use it as a search bar box, and using `class:focus` with increasing the width so it can be increased as the original website.
- Added the main text content with transparency for the color and using `text-shadow` instead to let the text look more blurry and similar to the original images used for the text on the original website.
- Using the bottom border instead of `text-decoration: underline;` for the hyperlink hover in the main content so I can make it closer to the text like the original website.
- Using the `display: grid;` & `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, auto);` for the banners to align theme like the original website.
- For the footer I used `display: grid;` & `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 490px);` to align it as the original website.
